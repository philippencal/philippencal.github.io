                            <p>I’m a brazilian software engineer who spend the whole day, practically every day, working
                                with .NET technologies, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with
                                React and Node.js; and trying to collect potentially usefull information through a few
                                hundred of tech web sites.</p>
                            <p>I build softwares and systems used in diverse companies. I love do it well. I’m curious,
                                and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different
                                direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can
                                meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.</p>
                            <p>The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of

                    <p>
                        At the moment, I’m a senior engineer at AlterDomus in Luxembourg, Europe.
                        But my career started so far away from here, in the agitated city of Curitiba in
                        Brazil, where I also born and grow up. In September 2010, still in high school, I
                        was looking for an internship and I got the opportunity to work in a tech startup
                        who is responsible for the truck sellers' digital market. I worked there for almost
                        a year where I deeped in the tech world, programming languages, and web concepts. I
                        remember at that time I didn't realize how to dealing with the huge and massive
                        study content to reach my personal goal, become a computer programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since that time, I never stopped to study, five hours week at least. I started to
                        feel that sensation of thirst for knowledge and I realized I needed to worked in a
                        big company to improve my skills. This thirst moved me to one of the biggest HR
                        companies in Brazil, were four good years with many projects, challenges, knowledge
                        acquired. I still remember the happy feeling just after solved a critical bug or
                        completing to building a complex algorithm and see it works and brings benefits to
                        the systems and their users. That's really amazing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After four long years, I decided to put my career on an international road. I moved
                        to a new company with new challenges, technologies, and the possibility to start to
                        see the English language on the systems. I know it can be little strange, but it
                        made all difference to me. In Brazil, we have not a good basic education on public
                        schools and you must learn English by yourself if you want to reach an acceptable
                        English level. Anyway, after a long year working with complex port systems, I
                        received an invitation to participate in a hiring processing for a developer
                        position in one of the most valuable and rich oil companies in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's definitely was a game changer in my career, I started to work with teams in
                        different parts of the world, start to understand how big corporations work, the
                        timezones, cultures, rules and process for everything. I really enjoyed to worked
                        there, besides increasing my programming skills, I also improved my English and made
                        good friends. At that time I worked in all types of company, startups, familiar,
                        medium, large and global companies. But I had never worked inside of a foreign team
                        before. So I decided to try, It was one of the most difficult decisions that I ever
                        made, I was quitting a dream job in a big and awarded company with a possibility to
                        make a brilliant career there.

                        After my decision, I started to work at home for an American digital marketing
                        company. Where I had the biggest technical progression in my career until now, I was
                        deeply involved in new technologies, the blockchain was just a "complex word" when
                        we start to implement a token in a company business model, here I became blockchain
                        expert. I also learned some data science concepts with my high skilled coworkers,
                        It's definitely changed my vision about software architecture. At the beginning of
                        2019 I decided to reach one of my most ambitious goals, live and work abroad.

                        I moved to Porto, the most beautiful city in Portugal (from my point of view, of course) to
                        work as a software engineer at a renowned technology startup. I had the pleasure of growing
                        as a professional and meeting wonderful people along the way. After some time I moved to
                        Luxembourg where I work since then I usually say god has strange ways to put you in the right
                        path, I think my entire career can be summed up in this sentence.

                        I was born in 1991 in Curitiba, Brazil. The capital of the state of Parana, I grew
                        up doing what every kid and teenage does, I played a lot of video games and as a
                        good Brazilian, I also played soccer while studying in a public high school. At the
                        end of high school, I met my true love and with that, I changed my concept of life
                        (Oh yes, so early). I started to create goals lists and planning how I could reach
                        each one of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I adopted a dog (one of my passions), got a degree and then a specialization degree
                        in software engineer, I married, started to get interested for finances market as a
                        hobby, data science became fascinating to me. I usually spend some time of my free
                        time studying it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With my career was progressing we decided to left Curitiba, where It was my home for
                        over 27 years. I'm still fanatic for soccer, Netflix and sometimes I still play
                        video games, some things never change. Now I'm a married man with no children (for
                        now) living in a different country, with a different culture, with 9.983 km between
                        me and my relatives. This can be scared sometimes, but I'm really proud of my
                        trajectory until here. Who knows what the destiny reserve for us, destiny is all.
